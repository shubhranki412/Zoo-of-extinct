                Titanoboa, (Titanoboa cerrejonensis), extinct snake that lived during the Paleocene Epoch (66
                million to
                56
                million years ago), considered to be the largest known member of the suborder Serpentes. Titanoboa
                is
                known
                from several fossils that have been dated to 58 million to 60 million years ago. From extrapolations
                of
                body
                size made from excavated vertebrae (individual sections of the backbone), paleontologists have
                estimated
                that the body length of the average adult Titanoboa was roughly 13 metres (42.7 feet) and the
                average
                weight
                about 1,135 kg (1.25 tons). Titanoboa is related to living anacondas and boas, but it is uncertain
                whether
                it was more closely related to one or another of these modern constrictor snakes.

                The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived during the
                Pleistocene
                until its extinction in the Holocene epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species,
                beginning
                with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the
                steppe
                mammoth about 800,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. DNA
                studies
                show that the Columbian mammoth was a hybrid between woolly mammoths and another lineage descended
                from
                steppe mammoths. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any
                prehistoric
                animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and North America, as well as
                skeletons,
                teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth
                remains
                had
                long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of
                these
                remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures.
                The
                mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.

                Dunkleosteus is an extinct genus of arthrodire placoderm fish that existed during the Late Devonian
                period, about 358–382 million years ago. The name Dunkleosteus combines the Greek ὀστέον, osteon,
                meaning "bone", and Dunkle, in honour of David Dunkle of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

                Helicoprion is an extinct genus of shark-like eugeneodont fish (a group of extinct cartilaginous
                fishes). Members of Eugenodontida possess a unique morphological feature called “tooth whorls”. They
                first appeared in the Devonian before going extinct in the Early Triassic.

                Sabre-toothed cats roamed North America and Europe throughout the Miocene and Pliocene epochs (23
                million to 2.6 million years ago). By Pliocene times, they had spread to Asia and Africa. During the
                Pleistocene, sabre-toothed cats were also present in South America.

                The "deino" in Deinosuchus derives from the same root as the "dino" in dinosaur, connoting
                "fearsome" or "terrible." In this case, the description is apt: Deinosuchus was one of the largest
                prehistoric crocodiles that ever lived, attaining lengths of up to 33 feet from head to tail and
                weights in the neighborhood of five to 10 tons.

                They put it at about 740 kilograms, easily earning the species the title of heavyweight rodent of
                all time. A disproportion between the front and rear limbs suggests that the creature could rest on
                its haunches and manipulate food with its front paws like its modern relatives do, says
                Snchez-Villagra.

                Parasaurolophus (/ˌpærəsɔːˈrɒləfəs, -ˌsɔːrəˈloʊfəs/; meaning "near crested lizard" in reference to
                Saurolophus) is a genus of herbivorous hadrosaurid ornithopod dinosaur that lived in what is now
                North America and possibly Asia during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 76.5–73 million years
                ago.[2] It was a herbivore that walked both as a biped and as a quadruped. Three species are
                universally recognized: P. walkeri (the type species), P. tubicen, and the short-crested P.
                cyrtocristatus. Additionally, a fourth species, P. jiayinensis, has been proposed, although it is
                more commonly placed in the separate genus Charonosaurus. Remains are known from Alberta (Canada),
                New Mexico and Utah (United States), and possibly Heilongjiang (China). The genus was first
                described in 1922 by William Parks from a skull and partial skeleton found in Alberta.

                Elasmotherium is an extinct genus of large rhinoceros endemic to Eurasia during Late Miocene through
                the Pleistocene, existing at least as late as 39,000 years ago in the Late Pleistocene.[2] A more
                recent date of 26,000 BP is considered less reliable.[2] It was the last surviving member of
                Elasmotheriinae, a distinctive group of rhinoceroses separate from the group that contains living
                rhinoceros (Rhinocerotinae). The two groups are estimated to have split at least 35 million years
                ago according to fossils and molecular evidence.

                The Tasmanian tiger, also called Tasmanian wolf and thylacine, was neither a tiger nor a wolf, but a
                marsupial, and closely related to the Tasmanian devil. The last known Tasmanian tiger died in 1936,
                but hundreds of unconfirmed sightings have spurred investigations into whether the animal still
                lives.

                The quagga is a subspecies of the plains zebra that was endemic to South Africa until it was hunted
                to extinction in the late 19th century. It was long thought to be a distinct species, but early
                genetic studies have supported it being a subspecies of plains zebra.
